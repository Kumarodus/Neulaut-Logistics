Neulaut is a logistics platform, providing seamless end to end supply chain for goods and service using blockchain technology. The Neulaut token, NUA which is a negotiable digital asset, shall enable users of the platform to pay for freight and other related  services and to monitor goods as they progress along the shipping and delivery phase of the process, capturing payment uncertainties and helping business extract value for whatever they have invested in the process. The platform uses the concept of space sharing, effectively matching owners of freight with shipping service providers globally. The paper work process is managed through smart contract and decentralised blockchain technllogy.The use of blockchain infrastructure will ensure layered security in confirmation and tracking of goods shipped through the platform, managing title documentation  and ownership permissions for the flow of goods and services across national entities and custom. With blockchain technology, the core system that underpins cryptocurrencies, computers of separately owned entities follow a cryptographic protocol to constantly validate updates to a commonly shared ledger. The importance of this decentralised system is that important information can be recorded in real time and since it is trustless, the platform does not require any one entity to be the controller of the value chain. Every participant in the platform has access to certain, irrefutable recorded information on the movement of goods and services. This eliminates the problems of errors of entry, and builds confidence in the intergrity of the database and enhances the process of  logistic accountability. The Neulaut system will engender trust amongst all participants.




The Neulaut Token, NUA

This the instrument for authenticating the security of the logistics flow of goods and services, serving as fuel that propels all activities on the paltform. Every user of the Neulaut platform will attach the tokens as a signature to every value add, and in so doing will ensure security and monitoring. This serves as an indelible mark from an originating party to a receiving party. The completion of a process represents  the selling out of a participants token, which can be realized for value. It's a value add, value enhancement and value creation process. Smart contracts will define the rights of every participants regarding obligations in the shipping and goods delivery process. This in some way will eliminate the old shipping terms, like collection, ex works and the rest of today's standard shipping arrangments. Cryptographic signatures will ensure that any employee is held accountable for their contribution in the value chain, while at the same time protecting their identity. The Neulaut token, NUA serve as the identity mark once it is signed and attached to each step  of the logistic flow.Encryption ensures that the risk of hacking and compromise is reduced to the barest minimum, why at the same time protecting all interest parties by ensuring that all authorised personel and their contribution to the chain is thoroughly monitored. This will eliminate shoddiness, complacency and ensures efficiency.
